# Customer-Energy-Usage-Forecast
Key Words: Predictive Modeling, Python

Here We have energy usage data for a set of customers. The data are a panel of invoices over a period of 2 years for a set of customers. The description of the variables are shown as below:

'Customer_id': Unique customer identifier

'Invoicefromdt': Start date of bill period

'Invoicetodt': End date of bill period

'Invoicedate': Date of invoice
'Kwh': Energy usage in kWh
'Geoid1': Geographical identifier
'Geoid2': Geographical identifier
'Score': Customer propensity score

Our objective is to summarize the data using the descriptive statistics and plots in order to find some patterns or insights. Then build a predictive model to forecast the customers' next invoice amount.
